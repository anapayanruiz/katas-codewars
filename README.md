## 1 Reversed sequence
 Get the number n (n>0) to return the reversed sequence from n to 1.
Example : n=5 >> [5,4,3,2,1]

## 2 Count the divisors of a number
Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.
Random tests go up to n = 500000.

## 3 Pokemon Damage Calculator
It's a Pokemon battle! Your task is to calculate the damage that a particular
move would do using the following formula (not the actual one from the
game):
damage = 50 * (attack / defense) * effectiveness
Make sure to round the result up to the nearest integer.

## 4 Range Extraction
A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma
separated list of either:
- individual integers
- or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from
the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all
integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a
range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example ("12, 13,
15-17")
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order
and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.
