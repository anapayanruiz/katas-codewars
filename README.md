## 1 Reversed sequence
 Get the number n (n>0) to return the reversed sequence from n to 1.
Example : n=5 >> [5,4,3,2,1]

## 2 Count the divisors of a number
Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.
Random tests go up to n = 500000.

## 3 Pokemon Damage Calculator
It's a Pokemon battle! Your task is to calculate the damage that a particular
move would do using the following formula (not the actual one from the
game):
damage = 50 * (attack / defense) * effectiveness
Make sure to round the result up to the nearest integer.

## 4 Array.diff
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
